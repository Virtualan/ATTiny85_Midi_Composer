# ATTiny85_Midi_Composer
Another attempt at a ATTiny85 midi project to generate midi music based upon light changes.

You can here the output here http://www.mixdowncentral.co.uk/data/music/ATTiny85XmasComposition.mp3

The Midi output is being fed to the Boss DS330 synth module then thru to a PC playing 4 instances of Kontakt set up with various multi instuments on the 16 available channels.

Light changes were from movement within the room and by switching on the odd lamp etc. (it was nighttime when I recorded the above)

Build one and try it yourself :)

Thanks!
